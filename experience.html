                    <p class="mb-0">After my freshman year of college, I put my academic career on hold to serve a 18 month proselyting mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It has been the best decision of my life. I was able to serve others and God. It also allowed me to learn important life skills like how to work with others, teach for understanding, and keep a schedule.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">After returned home from my mission, I wanted to continue to hone these skills and put my efforts into someone besides myself. I went with a company called the International Language Program to Pachuca, Mexico for four months. Not only did I get to practice the skill I learned on my mission to speak spanish, there I was able to volunteer as an english teacher for young kids. I learned patience and love through those children. I learned how to better plan ahead as I planned lessons and also command and keep the attention of a room.</p>
